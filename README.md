# SpringBoard_Settings_Changes_in_Screenshots
So the impatient and eager can look into this instead of going to @hamzasood timeline and check the new internal settings.

***** Found striaght in the iOS simulator w/ simject and with a modified version of AdvancedSettinsg8 recompiled for the iOS simulator. *****
But I never got it to work w/ Xcode 7 or Xcode 5 or Xcode 6 for some reason :(

Btw I'll soon give you the link to install the recompiled AdvancedSettings8 dylib to test as long as you have the simject and Xcode 8.3 installed then you should be good to go.

Not tested on iOS 9 simulator and I think it'd be prone to a crash if I did load the recompiled AdavcnedSettings8 dylib in it's folder path -.-

Btw when iOS 11 comes out I'll upload pics here too if you all want me to now I needa watch anime
