# SpringBoard_Settings_Changes_in_Screenshots
So the developers out there - or just the curious (or the impatient and eager) - can look into this instead of going to @hamzasood's Twitter profile to check the any new SpringBoard internal prototype settings that *he* has Tweeted.

**This was found straight in the iOS Simulator along with a modified build of AdvancedSettings8** (which was compiled for the iOS Simulator specifically, and only for the x86_64 archictecture only of said iOS Simulator), **and simject**. Please use the x86_64 iOS Simulator models that come preinstalled with (any version of?) Xcode 8, and not the other models (like iPhone 5, etc. They simply will not launch as far as I'm aware of :/).

I will soon post the recompiled AdvancedSettings8 and it's accompanying files for you to test (so long as you have Xcode, Theos, and simject installed), and then you should be good to go.

By the way, this was theoretically **not** tested (yet?) to work with the iOS Simulator models lower than iOS 10's Simulators. So, it was not tested with the iOS 7 Simulator, iOS 8 Simulator, or iOS 9 Simulator - in mind. And even if it were, I don't think that it would work, as it'd just be prone to a possible SpringBoard crash (or a freeze of the SpringBoard) - forcing you to reboot, or close out of the iOS Simulator and reopening it - after you tap and hold on the Settings app icon to invoke the internal prototype settings).
I, for some reason, simply **never ever** got it to work with the aformentioned iOS Simulators at all. :(

Only tested on iOS 10.0, iOS 10.1, iOS 10.3 Simulators.

It's also a good idea to please not try this out on an actual iOS device, as you may risk loosing your jailbroken install, and that could cause you to restore somehow (with iTunes, etc., of course :P). And we don't want **that** happening now, do we? ;)

*no chase fromm we dont want that happening, cries the readers. we will take care of our ios devices like the good people we are.
**we prooooomiiiise!!!**

off you go!
