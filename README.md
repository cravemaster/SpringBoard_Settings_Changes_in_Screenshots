# SpringBoard_Settings_Changes_in_Screenshots
So that the developers (and the curious - or even the impatient and eager) people out there - can look into this instead of going to @hamzasood's Twitter profile to check the any new SpringBoard internal prototype settings that *he* has Tweeted.

The future tutorial that will be written soon should mainly be considered a tutorial that is a much more complete version than this here current one, and this here current one should hopefully be geared to and useful mainly for many developers who use the iOS Simulator/iOS Toolchain on a day-to-day basis and on an occasional basis, and to those who have the **delibrate intention** to install custom tweaks, libraries, etc. on their iOS Simulators that require Cydia Substrate to test this is on and really should **not be meant for the fate of heart** (so for simple end users). If you **do not know what simject is, then please close this page (to avoid simple obsession over it)!!!** It can **potentially damage the files you have installed, as well as Xcode, and the iOS Simulator as well**. There are reasons to why you just do not use such things in life and you just shouldn't mess and diddle around with them if you are a beginner, and this is one of them.

After almost four years, I **finally** have something for you internal fans out there (and just casual jailbreakers in general who love to customize their devices). Screenshots (and an upcoming "how to access" tutorial, which will be available on my GitHub page) of the internal SpringBoard prototype settings that Apple has in iOS. Apple indeed uses these internal settings for things like speed adjustments, etc. It however has been hidden since iOS 7.0 beta 1, but @hamzasood on Twitter - a famous jailbreak developer who's famous for tweaks in Cydia, and messing and poking around throughout various places in iOS and the iOS SDK - has uncovered them long ago. He *did* create a post on how to access them, but it was extremely vague to the end user. However, many have not been able to access them on the iOS Simulator alone. I found out how to access them myself after tinkering with the iOS Simulator just mere years later. It works, and now you can do the same. But please do keep in mind: youcan only access these here in the is **iOS Simulator**, **not an actual iOS device** (which is not easy - and quite confusing - for the laymen. And it's kind of a hell of a task, in fact). Accessing it on an actual iOS device itself will require a jailbreak (or at least partial root read/write permissions to the filesystem) to access the internal SpringBoard prototype settings menu.

The menu was accessed not only by using the iOS Simulator, but also by hacking it to use Cydia Substrate; essentially to load custom modifications to it, such as my modifed version of AdvancedSettings8, and my modified version of the Developer Settings bundle (which you can use for toggling on two toggles, which you can hereby access by inserting the custom bundle in it's appropriate folder location, restarting the iOS Simulator, opening Settings, going to Developer, and by enabling both the "Access SpringBoard Settings", and "Access SpringBoard Settings (SIM)" switches, then closing out of Settings, and last but not least, tapping and holding on the Settings app icon to invoke the menu, like so.

To reiterate: **this was found straight in the iOS 10 Simulator, along with a modified build of AdvancedSettings8** (which was compiled for the iOS Simulator *specifically*, and **only** for the x86_64 archictecture of said iOS Simulator), **a modified Developer Settings bundle, and simject**. Please use the x86_64 iOS Simulator models that come preinstalled with (any version of) Xcode 8 (like the iPhone 5S, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, etc. models), and not the other models that have the i386 slice (like iPhone 5, etc.) They simply will not launch (as far as I'm aware of :/).

By the way, this was theoretically **not** tested to work with the iOS Simulator models lower than iOS 10's Simulators. So, it was not tested with the iOS 7 Simulator, iOS 8 Simulator, or iOS 9 Simulator. And even if it were tested, I doubt that it would show the internal settings menu, as it'd just be prone to a possible SpringBoard crash (or even a possible freeze of the SpringBoard), forcing you to reboot (or just close out of the iOS Simulator and reopening it) after you tap and hold on the Settings app icon to invoke the internal settings menu, as such).

In conclusion: this is something that I recommend for **developers only**. In this such example, it was only ever been tested in the iOS Simulator versions; that of which being iOS 10.0, iOS 10.1, and iOS 10.3 Simulator.

NOTE: There will soon be a link for downloading the recompiled AdvancedSettings8 and the Developer Settings bundle, and all of it's accompanying files for you to put in it's appropriate folder locations, and test (provided you have all of the necessary files and things aformentioned), and then you should be good to go.

**AT LOST LAST, YOU FINALLY CAN USE THESE IN THE IOS 10 SIMULATOR! LINK ON THIS GITHUB PAGE!**
